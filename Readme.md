## Overview

Build a responsive and personalized dashboard that displays user-specific data in real-time.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- User Authentication:
  Implement a simple login system (can be mock authentication).
  Store user preferences locally (e.g., theme, layout).
- Dashboard Components:
  Create a sidebar with navigation options.
  Design widgets or cards to display different types of data, such as weather, to-do lists, recent activity, etc.
  Implement drag-and-drop functionality to rearrange widgets.
- Real-Time Updates:
  Integrate a real-time data source (e.g., a public API for weather, news, or stock prices) to display live data.
  Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to update a specific widget in real-time without refreshing the page.
- Responsive Design:
  Ensure the dashboard is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices.
  Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout management.
- Additional Feature:
  Implement a dark mode toggle that persists across sessions.
  Make design responsive for any 2 size screens (mobile and desktop).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- grid
- flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- OpenWeather api

### What I learned

The challenging part was Integration of API and its various aspects. The part which taught me something new was drag and drop feature for the various cards on the main page .

### Continued development

I would keep working on my dom and getting better with it along learning react to solidify my frontend skills.
